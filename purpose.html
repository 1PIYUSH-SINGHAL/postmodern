        <h1>Our Purpose</h1>
        <p>
          Being modern is no longer enough. Education must evolve beyond
          standardisation, conformity, and passive learning.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="purpose-statement">
        <p>
          The PostModern exists to challenge how education is designed,
          delivered, and experienced — especially for those historically
          excluded from quality learning environments.

          <h3>Learning Is Not Uniform</h3>
          <p>
            Intelligence is diverse. Minds process information differently.
            Education must adapt to the learner — not force the learner to adapt
            to rigid systems.

          <h3>Access Shapes Outcomes</h3>
          <p>
            Educational inequality is not a lack of ability, but a lack of
            access. We focus on underprivileged and intellectually
            special-abled learners who are often left behind.

        <article class="pillar">
          <h3>Retention Over Rote</h3>
          <p>
            Memorisation without understanding is failure disguised as success.
            We prioritise evidence-based learning methods such as active recall,
            spaced repetition, and concept-driven education.

      <section class="purpose-closing">
        <h2>Why The PostModern?</h2>
        <p>
          Because progress demands questioning what already exists.
          <br />
          Because learning should empower — not exclude.
          <br />
          Because education must finally be designed for humans.
